# report-cybercrime

A Selenium script to make that nasty Cybercrime website easier to deal with and to scale up our reporting capacity.


## How to Use

1) First write a report and collect the appropriate data. 

2) Then upload it to a cloud provider you can link too.

3) Fill in the hard-coded sections of this script, leaving 'test_report = True'.

4) Test the selenium script, if it completes the form properly you can set 'test_report = False' and re-run it to complete the report.
